                <p class="lead">Google has handled things quite differently this year when it comes to rumors. While they continue to hold firm about not commenting on circulated rumors about upcoming products and services, the company surprised everyone when it confirmed the back design of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL after it was leaked. Today, a new leak suggests the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will both ship with a 90Hz display that Google calls “Smooth Display,” 6GB of RAM, and some additional features have been revealed as well.
                    <br>
                    <br> We’ve been hearing details about the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL for a while now. Anyone who wants to catch up is encouraged to check out the rumor roundup we did about the two phones last month. So far we’ve learned about the design of the two devices including some much improved facial recognition technology , air gestures that Google is calling Motion Sense , a Pixel Themes app , and more. Now, we’re hearing some rumors about the hardware specs of the two unreleased Pixel smartphones.
                    <br>
                    <br> As reported by 9to5Google, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will largely be the same phone. Granted, the XL version will be bigger with what is said to be a 6.3-inch OLED display while the regular variant will be sporting a 5.7-inch screen. Pixel counters should know the regular version will only be Full HD+ (1080p) while the bigger will sport UHD (1440p). Both phones, however, are rumored to have 6GB of RAM, a 90Hz “Smooth Display” feature (presumably optional in the display settings), and the same cameras/sensors.
                    <br>
                    <br> We’re expecting one of the rear cameras to be a 12MP sensor with phase-detect auto-focus while the secondary one is a 16MP telephoto lens. Smaller sizes mean smaller batteries and the regular Pixel 4 is likely going to ship with a 2,800mAh battery (down from 2,915mAh with the Pixel 3). On the other hand, the Pixel 4 XL gets a boost with a battery capacity of 3,700mAh (up from a 3,430mAh battery in the Pixel 3 XL). Google is said to be advertising stereo speakers in its 2019 flagship smartphones, the Titan M security chip, and possible some Google Assistant exclusive features.
