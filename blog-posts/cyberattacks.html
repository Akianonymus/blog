                <p class="lead">With the never ending and ever evolving technology, strides in business outcomes, threat landscape has also evolved. Mobile phones and computer systems are too less of examples, smart assistants, autonomous cars and smart homes have totally changed the way we are.
                    <br>
                    <br> No doubt the technology has helped us with our ways but it has also increased the vulnerabilities in it. Malware attacks and data breaches making the headlines every other day have posed a big question for the technology leaders.
                    <br>
                    <br> A research put out by capgemini "reinventing cybersecurity with AI" finds out AI is the way out here.
                    <br> Let's see how
	            <br>
                    <font size="10">AI helping with cybersecurity:</font>
                    <br> With organisations being expected to increase the use of cryptography, they need to leverage modern day technology as Artificial Intelligence to prevent, detect and recover the threats. For instance, malware communicates and flows in an encrypted form on the web. In such a situation, those tools shall be deployed which can detect and prevent the cryptography to mask malicious activities. With time, AI in the systems should be able to automatically learn and detect unusual patterns in the network traffic. These abilities of tech can reshape the way we deal with cybersecurity. AI can differentiate in what is a potential threat and what could be safe.
                    <br>
                    <br> Artificial intelligence manages to create algorithms that can identify the risks, make devices defend them and corrects vulnerabilities thus making it easier for cybersecurity professionals. If AI takes up the charge over cybersecurity, techies can be freed for high level tasks and operations. The advantage that AI here offers is that it can be developed and trained in a way that it supersedes the human abilities.
                    <br>
                    <br> CISOs being unable to prevent the business from highly developed malware and other threat vectors posees a big question mark on the security of organisations. With AI coming into place, there might be some relief for the cybersecurity people to detect and prevent the anomalies timely.
                    <br>
                    <br> Artificial intelligence is however unlikely to make the business cent percent secure but it can help CISOs bring down the number of breaches and cyber attacks. Gathering and correlating data which was earlier done manually is now done by machines, owing to Artificial intelligence. This also helps enterprises with the skills gap they face today in the cybersecurity domain. AI can bring down the risk to a level which can be easily managed by IT professionals.
