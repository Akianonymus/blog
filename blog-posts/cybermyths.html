                <p class="lead">Today almost every enterprises has a well defined cybersecurity strategy. Ironically even the most thought of cybersecurity projects worked with well meaning goals can miss the mark sometimes. If an organisation believes in some of the myths while forming the security strategy, it could risk the whole enterprise.
                    <br>
                    <br> Listed below are the top 5 myths :
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>1. IT department can take care of the risks/ threats</h4>
                    <br> It is in the hands of the IT department to implement and review the security plans and strategy but they can not take care of everything. Each employee in the organisation is equally responsible when it comes to security. Proper training and skill is thus needed so that employees can make themselves secure from malware and unsafe websites.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>2. Technology can control the email security alone</h4>
                    <br> People depend on technology for email security to trace malicious threads in internal as well as external servers and mitigating future risks. Businesses need to train their employees to engage well with inherited technology to escalate the process of detection and developing a secured hygiene.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>3. Cyber threats are only external.</h4>
                    <br> Many people say that cybersecurity dangers originate from external environment. Almost 75% of the data breaches are an aftereffect of somebody within. A displeased representative, an ex-worker with resentment, or just an insensible client on your system can give access to your whole association's information bringing about a monstrous information break. It is therefore a smart thought to train the employees and show them digital dangers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>4.  Working on BYOD model is safe.</h4>
                    <br> Bring your own device is surely a cost effective measure for the businesses to operate but not the most secure one. It will only take a weak link to cripple the whole network system. Businesses working on BYOD model need to make sure that all the employees abide by the cybersecurity policies.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>5. Only certain industries suffer form data breaches.</h4>
                    <br> Few organisations still believe that hackers won't get to their systems because of they being small-mid sized or they belong to some certain industry. Organisations also falsely believe that hackers wont find anything valuable to take from their systems. If nothing there sure will be personal financial details and card numbers thus making everyone a potential target to be hacked.
