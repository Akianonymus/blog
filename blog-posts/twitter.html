                <!-- Post Content -->
                <p class="lead">Twitter said on Tuesday that it may have used data for personalised ads without a user's permission due to issues with the microblogging website's settings.
                    <br> The company said it recently discovered those issues and fixed them on Monday, although it hasn't yet determined who may have been impacted.
                    <br>
                    <br> Consumer data is a powerful tool that companies use to decide where to place advertisements, what content to feature, and which consumers might be interested in the product.
                    <br> Big technology companies have been under scrutiny from regulators around the world over their data sharing practices.
                    <br>
                    <br> The data that Twitter said it might have used include a person's country code, their engagement details with a particular ad and inferences made about the devices they use.
                    <br> "You trust us to follow your choices and we failed here," Twitter said on its website, along with an apology and a promise to take steps to not repeat the "mistake."
                    <br>
                    <br> Because of those issues, where a user's settings choices may not have worked as intended, Twitter said it could have shared a user's data with its advertising partners or displayed ads based on information it collected without permission.</p>
