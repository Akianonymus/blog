                <p class="lead">le has announced new back to school deals for students. As a part of its newly announced offer, Google is giving three months of YouTube Music Premium or YouTube Premium, which includes YouTube Music Premium, YouTube Originals, YouTube Kids and YouTube Gaming, free as a part of the trial period.
                    <br>
                    <br> Once the trial period expires, the deal then encourages the students to sign up for a discounted plan as a part of which the Mountain View, California based company would offer YouTube Music Premium for $4.99 (Rs Rs 352 approx) per month instead of $9.99 (Rs 705 approx) per month. Similarly, the company would offer YouTube Premium at $6.99 (Rs 493 approx) per month to students as a part of its back to school deal.
                    <br>
                    <br> Students can either continue to use the benefits offered by the two services that are available as a part of the discounted plan or cancel the subscription once the trial period is over.
                    <br>
                    <br> The deal was announced by YouTube in a tweet on Twitter. "For a limited time, new members can enjoy 3 months of the #YouTubeMusic Premium or @YouTube Premium student plan in select territories, on us. Let us know what you're playing to get #BacktoSchool," the company wrote in the tweet.
                    <br>
                    <br> It is worth noting that so far this plan is available only for the students residing in the United States and the company has not announced similar plans for students in India.
                    <br>
                    <br> That said, Google had announced special plans for students in India back in May this year. As a part of its students plan, Google offers the YouTube Music Premium for Rs 59 per month in India. On the other hand, the YouTbe Premium is available for Rs 79 per month for students in India.
                    <br>
                    <br> To recall, YouTube had launched the YouTube Music Premium and the YouTube Premium in India back in March this year. At the time, the company had introduced two tiers of its plans for its two services. YouTube Music Premium costs Rs 99 per month and the YouTube Premium costs Rs 129 per month for the individuals. As far as the family plan is concerned, YouTube Premium costs Rs 189 per month in which users can add up to five family members.
