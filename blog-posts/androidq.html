                <p class="lead">The final Android Q beta is here. As expected , Google has kicked off August by releasing Android Q Beta 6. Like last month’s Android Q Beta 5 update, this is a “release candidate” build. That means it should be pretty close to the final build we’ll see this Fall. However, that doesn’t mean Google is done making changes. Let’s take a look.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="lead">Once again, the finalized developer APIs, official API 29 SDK, and updated builds tools for Android Studio are included. Google has also continued to refine the Gesture Navigation in Android Q Beta 6. The Gesture Navigation system has been the most contentious part of Android Q and Google claims to be listening to user feedback.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="lead">A lot of the work being done with Android Q Beta 6 is under the hood. The final release of Android Q is coming soon and Google wants developers to get their apps ready. Now is the time to install apps on Android Q, test the new privacy features , and push the newly compatible app to the Play Store. Google also recommends that apps now include a Dark Theme or enable Force Dark. They also recommend apps support the new Gesture Navigation and foldable devices.</p>
                <br>

                <p class="lead">Android Q Beta 6 is available now for Pixel devices by enrolling in the Android Beta program. Other OEMs that are participating in the Android Q beta will be updating their device over the next few weeks.
