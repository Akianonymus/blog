                <p class="lead">The Delhi cabinet on Thursday approved free Wi-Fi hotspots across the national capital.

                    <br>Addressing the media, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said there will be 11,000 hotspots all over the city.
                    <br>
                    <br>"A total of 4,000 hotspots will be installed at bus shelters and 7,000 in various colonies. Each of the 70 Assembly constituency will get 100 hotspots," he said.
                    <br>
                    <br> The project, with an estimated cost of Rs. 100 crores, will be on ground in three-four months, Kejriwal said.
                    <br>
                    <br> Each user will get 15GB limit per month. "About 200 users can use the hotspots simultaneously having a speed of 200Mbps in a radius of 50 metres," he added.
                    <br>
                    <br> The Wi-Fi project, an election promise of the Aam Aadmi Party, has missed a number of deadlines.
                    <br>
                    <br> Kejriwal on Thursday said although the time and technology had changed, youths kept asking him about the project. "The free Wi-Fi will be an addition to what people are already getting from the telecom companies."
                    <br>
                    <br> The Chief Minister said his election promises had a deadline of five years, which will end in February 2020. "All our election promises had a deadline of five years and we will complete the projects by then," Kejriwal said.
                    <br>
                    <br> In its 2015 election manifesto, the AAP promised to make Wi-Fi freely available in public spaces across Delhi. "Citywide Wi-Fi can help in bridging the digital divide. It will also provide an impetus to education, entrepreneurship, business, employment and also tie in with women's safety initiatives," the manifesto read.</p>
